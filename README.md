# kit

Here is a very simple, typical, extendable/delete-able client-side web setup. I wanted something I could reference for future projects without having to rewrite all of the usual tooling.

## Scripts

```
npm start
```
Start a Webpack Dev Server with hot reloading

```
npm run watch
```
Webpack the JS and Sass with source maps and watch for updates

```
npm run build
```
Webpack the JS and Sass for production, generate HTML index
